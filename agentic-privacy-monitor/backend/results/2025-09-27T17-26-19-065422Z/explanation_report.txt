Overall Risk Level: Moderate

**Data Privacy Impact Assessment**

This report summarizes the privacy assessment findings for several datasets. The assessment was conducted using the Model Context Protocol (MCP) tool to evaluate potential privacy risks. The goal is to provide a clear understanding of these risks and recommend appropriate actions.

**Dataset: 2021Census_G01_NSW_LGA.csv**

*   **Privacy Risks/Flags:** The dataset contains 'LGA_CODE_2021' as a quasi-identifier, which, when combined with other attributes, could potentially lead to re-identification. No sensitive columns were detected.
*   **Recommended Actions:** Consider adding data masking or aggregation techniques to further reduce the risk of re-identification. Review data access policies.
*   **MCP Metric Findings:**
    *   k-anonymity: minimum = 1, average = 1, required threshold = 10, status = Not met
    *   l-diversity: minimum = 1, average = 1, method = None, required threshold = 3, status = Not met
    *   t-closeness: maximum = 0.95, average = 0.9, method = None, required threshold = 0.8, status = Not met
    *   re-identification risk: 0.15, required threshold = 0.1, status = Met
*   **Risk Level:** Moderate

**Dataset: 2021Census_G02_NSW_LGA.csv**

*   **Privacy Risks/Flags:** The dataset contains 'LGA_CODE_2021' as a quasi-identifier, which, when combined with other attributes, could potentially lead to re-identification. No sensitive columns were detected.
*   **Recommended Actions:** Consider adding data masking or aggregation techniques to further reduce the risk of re-identification. Review data access policies.
*   **MCP Metric Findings:**
    *   k-anonymity: minimum = 1, average = 1, required threshold = 10, status = Not met
    *   l-diversity: minimum = 1, average = 1, method = None, required threshold = 3, status = Not met
    *   t-closeness: maximum = 0.92, average = 0.88, method = None, required threshold = 0.8, status = Not met
    *   re-identification risk: 0.14, required threshold = 0.1, status = Met
*   **Risk Level:** Moderate

**Dataset: 2021Census_G03_NSW_LGA.csv**

*   **Privacy Risks/Flags:** This dataset contains the sensitive column 'Total_Total' and the quasi-identifier `LGA_CODE_2021`.
*   **Recommended Actions:** Implement strict access controls to 'Total_Total'. Consider data masking or suppression techniques for this sensitive column where appropriate.
*   **MCP Metric Findings:**
    *   k-anonymity: minimum = 1, average = 1, required threshold = 10, status = Not met
    *   l-diversity: minimum = 1, average = 1, method = None, required threshold = 3, status = Not met
    *   t-closeness: maximum = 0.94, average = 0.93, method = None, required threshold = 0.8, status = Not met
    *   re-identification risk: 0.17, required threshold = 0.1, status = Met
*   **Risk Level:** Moderate

**Dataset: synthetic_privacy_test.csv**

*   **Privacy Risks/Flags:** The dataset includes 'ID' as a quasi-identifier and 'Disease' as a sensitive attribute.
*   **Recommended Actions:** Implement data masking or pseudonymization for the 'ID' column. Review access to the 'Disease' column.
*   **MCP Metric Findings:**
    *   k-anonymity: minimum = 1, average = 1, required threshold = 10, status = Not met
    *   l-diversity: minimum = 1, average = 1, method = None, required threshold = 3, status = Not met
    *   t-closeness: maximum = 0.96, average = 0.95, method = None, required threshold = 0.8, status = Not met
    *   re-identification risk: 0.20, required threshold = 0.1, status = Met
*   **Risk Level:** Moderate

**Dataset: types-of-health-insurance-coverage-by-age.csv**

*   **Privacy Risks/Flags:** No quasi-identifiers or sensitive columns were detected.
*   **Recommended Actions:** No immediate actions are required based on the current assessment. However, monitor for future additions of quasi-identifiers or sensitive attributes.
*   **MCP Metric Findings:**
    *   k-anonymity: N/A
    *   l-diversity: N/A
    *   t-closeness: N/A
    *   re-identification risk: N/A
*   **Risk Level:** Low

**Overall Assessment and Next Steps:**

Several datasets present moderate privacy risks due to the presence of quasi-identifiers and, in some cases, sensitive attributes. The low values for k-anonymity, l-diversity and t-closeness across several datasets indicate that the data is vulnerable to re-identification.

**Next Steps:**

1.  Implement the recommended actions for each dataset.
2.  Regularly re-evaluate datasets for new quasi-identifiers or sensitive attributes.
3.  Investigate the reasons for the low metric values and explore mitigation strategies.
4. Consider the data minimization principles and only collect necessary data.

By taking these steps, you can strengthen your data privacy posture and reduce the risk of unauthorized access and re-identification.
