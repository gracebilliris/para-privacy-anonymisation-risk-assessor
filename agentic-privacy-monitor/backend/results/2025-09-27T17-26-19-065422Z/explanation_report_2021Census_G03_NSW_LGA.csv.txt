## Privacy Assessment: 2021Census_G03_NSW_LGA.csv

This report summarizes a privacy assessment conducted on the dataset `2021Census_G03_NSW_LGA.csv`. The assessment focused on identifying potential privacy risks and evaluating the dataset against key privacy metrics using the Model Context Protocol.

**Privacy Risks:**

The assessment identified several privacy risks:

*   **k-anonymity below threshold:**  k-anonymity measures how well data is disguised within groups.  Currently, the dataset doesn't meet the required k-anonymity threshold (a minimum group size of 5). This means individuals may be easier to re-identify.
*   **l-diversity below threshold:** l-diversity ensures that sensitive information within each group has enough variation. The dataset does not meet the required l-diversity threshold (a minimum of 3 distinct values for sensitive attributes within groups). This means sensitive information within groups is too similar, potentially increasing re-identification risk.
*   **t-closeness above threshold:** t-closeness measures how closely the distribution of sensitive attributes in a group matches the overall dataset distribution.  The dataset's t-closeness is high (0.9924), suggesting a greater risk of sensitive attribute disclosure.

**Model Context Protocol Findings:**

*   **k-anonymity:** Minimum group size: 1, Average group size: 1.0, Required threshold: 5.  *Not met.*
*   **l-diversity:** Minimum diversity: 1.0, Average diversity: 1.0, Method: distinct, Required threshold: 3. *Not met.*
*   **t-closeness:** 0.9923664122137406, Required threshold: 0.2. *Above threshold.*
*   **Re-identification risk:** 0.1, Required threshold: 0.1.

**Quasi-Identifiers:** The dataset contains the quasi-identifier `LGA_CODE_2021`. Quasi-identifiers are attributes that, when combined, could potentially identify an individual.

**Sensitive Columns:** The dataset contains the sensitive column `Total_Total`.

**Recommended Actions:**

Based on the findings, we recommend the following actions to improve data privacy:

*   **Generalize or Suppress Quasi-Identifiers:** Consider generalizing or suppressing the `LGA_CODE_2021` quasi-identifier.  Generalization replaces specific values with broader categories.
*   **Increase Diversity:** Generalize quasi-identifiers to increase data diversity, or consider alternative methods to ensure data diversity.
*    **Attribute Transformation:** Consider generalising or binning sensitive variables differently to reduce the risk of disclosure.

**Risk Level:**

**Moderate**

The dataset poses a moderate privacy risk due to the identified k-anonymity and l-diversity violations, and the high t-closeness. While the re-identification risk is relatively low (0.1), the combination of factors warrants attention.

**Overall Assessment and Next Steps:**

This dataset requires further attention to address the identified privacy risks. The current configuration does not adequately protect individual privacy.  We recommend implementing the suggested actions to improve k-anonymity, l-diversity, and reduce t-closeness. 

Ongoing privacy protection should include regular monitoring of these metrics and periodic reassessments of the dataset as data changes or new analytical techniques are applied. Further analysis may be needed to fully understand the potential impact of the identified risks.
