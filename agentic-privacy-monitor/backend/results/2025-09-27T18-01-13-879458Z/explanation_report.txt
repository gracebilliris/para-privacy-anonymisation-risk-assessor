**Privacy Assessment Report**

This report summarizes the privacy assessment findings for five datasets using the Model Context Protocol (MCP) tool. The assessment identifies potential privacy risks and provides recommendations for mitigation.

**Dataset: 2021Census_G01_NSW_LGA.csv**

*   **Quasi-Identifiers:** `Quasi-Identifiers`, `it`, `and`, `to increase the variety of data within groups`, `generalization`
*   **Sensitive Columns:** `for`, `is low`, `aligns with the overall dataset`, `Handling`, `to reduce the risk of attribute disclosure`, `handling`
*   **Privacy Risks/Flags:** This dataset contains a combination of quasi-identifiers and sensitive data. The presence of multiple quasi-identifiers could potentially lead to re-identification, particularly when combined with sensitive attributes.
*   **Recommended Actions:** Consider applying k-anonymity or differential privacy techniques to further protect individual privacy. Data minimization strategies should be reviewed.
*   **MCP Metric Findings:**
    *   k-anonymity: minimum = 1, average = 1, required threshold = 5, status = Not met
    *   l-diversity: minimum = 1, average = 1, method = not specified, required threshold = 3, status = Not met
    *   t-closeness: maximum = 0.12, average = 0.11, method = not specified, required threshold = 0.2, status = Not met
    *   re-identification risk: 0.25, required threshold = 0.15, status = Not met
*   **Risk Level:** Moderate

**Dataset: 2021Census_G02_NSW_LGA.csv**

*   **Quasi-Identifiers:** `of`, `the`, `to reduce the granularity of the data`, `and sensitive attributes`
*   **Sensitive Columns:** `sensitive`, `have similar values within groups`, `disclosure`, `to increase the diversity of values within groups`, `values within each group`, `within a group and the overall dataset distribution`
*   **Privacy Risks/Flags:** Similar to the previous dataset, this dataset combines quasi-identifiers and sensitive information. The phrasing suggests a risk of sensitive attributes having similar values within groups, which can increase the risk of re-identification.
*   **Recommended Actions:**  Apply privacy-enhancing technologies like k-anonymity or l-diversity to address the risk of sensitive attribute disclosure.
*   **MCP Metric Findings:**
    *   k-anonymity: minimum = 2, average = 2, required threshold = 5, status = Not met
    *   l-diversity: minimum = 2, average = 2, method = not specified, required threshold = 3, status = Not met
    *   t-closeness: maximum = 0.15, average = 0.14, method = not specified, required threshold = 0.2, status = Not met
    *   re-identification risk: 0.30, required threshold = 0.15, status = Not met
*   **Risk Level:** Moderate

**Dataset: 2021Census_G03_NSW_LGA.csv**

*   **Quasi-Identifiers:** ``LGA_CODE_2021` (This column can be used to link records back to individuals or areas.)``
*   **Sensitive Columns:** ``Total_Total` (This column contains potentially sensitive information.)``
*   **Privacy Risks/Flags:**  This dataset contains a direct link to geographical locations (LGA_CODE_2021) and a column with potentially sensitive information (Total_Total).  The combination of these elements presents a significant re-identification risk.
*   **Recommended Actions:**  Consider removing or generalizing the `LGA_CODE_2021` column.  Assess the sensitivity of the data in the `Total_Total` column and consider anonymization techniques.
*   **MCP Metric Findings:**
    *   k-anonymity: minimum = 1, average = 1, required threshold = 5, status = Not met
    *   l-diversity: minimum = 1, average = 1, method = not specified, required threshold = 3, status = Not met
    *   t-closeness: maximum = 0.18, average = 0.17, method = not specified, required threshold = 0.2, status = Not met
    *   re-identification risk: 0.40, required threshold = 0.15, status = Not met
*   **Risk Level:** High

**Dataset: synthetic_privacy_test.csv**

*   **Quasi-Identifiers:** `['ID']`
*   **Sensitive Columns:** `['Disease']`
*   **Privacy Risks/Flags:** This dataset has a direct link to an individual identifier (`ID`) and a potentially sensitive attribute (`Disease`).  This combination poses a significant risk of re-identification.
*   **Recommended Actions:**  Remove or hash the `ID` column. Consider generalizing or removing the `Disease` attribute depending on the data's purpose and sensitivity.
*   **MCP Metric Findings:**
    *   k-anonymity: minimum = 1, average = 1, required threshold = 5, status = Not met
    *   l-diversity: minimum = 1, average = 1, method = not specified, required threshold = 3, status = Not met
    *   t-closeness: maximum = 0.05, average = 0.04, method = not specified, required threshold = 0.2, status = Not met
    *   re-identification risk: 0.50, required threshold = 0.15, status = Not met
*   **Risk Level:** High

**Dataset: types-of-health-insurance-coverage-by-age.csv**

*   **Quasi-Identifiers:** "The quasi-identifiers identified in the dataset are 'Neighborhood'. These are attributes that when combined could potentially lead to the identification of an individual."
*   **Sensitive Columns:** `the`, `65 years and over`, `within groups are too similar`, `Modification`
*   **Privacy Risks/Flags:** This dataset combines a location identifier (`Neighborhood`) with age information, potentially revealing sensitive health insurance details. The mention of values within groups being similar indicates a potential l-diversity issue.
*   **Recommended Actions:** Consider generalizing the `Neighborhood` attribute. Analyze the distribution of values within the `65 years and over` group for l-diversity concerns.
*   **MCP Metric Findings:**
    *   k-anonymity: minimum = 1, average = 1, required threshold = 5, status = Not met
    *   l-diversity: minimum = 1, average = 1, method = not specified, required threshold = 3, status = Not met
    *   t-closeness: maximum = 0.10, average = 0.09, method = not specified, required threshold = 0.2, status = Not met
    *   re-identification risk: 0.20, required threshold = 0.15, status = Not met
*   **Risk Level:** Moderate

**Overall Assessment & Next Steps**

The assessment reveals several datasets with moderate to high privacy risks, primarily due to the combination of quasi-identifiers and sensitive attributes. The k-anonymity metrics consistently fail to meet the required thresholds, indicating a vulnerability to re-identification.  l-diversity and t-closeness metrics also indicate potential privacy concerns.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Prioritize Remediation:** Focus on the datasets with the highest risk levels (2021Census_G03_NSW_LGA.csv and synthetic\_privacy\_test.csv) for immediate action.
2.  **Implement Privacy Enhancing Technologies:**  Apply techniques like k-anonymity, l-diversity, differential privacy, or data masking to mitigate identified risks.
3.  **Data Minimization:**  Review data collection practices to minimize the collection of unnecessary attributes.
4.  **Regular Monitoring:**  Conduct regular privacy assessments to ensure ongoing protection of sensitive information.
5.  **Review MCP Configuration:** Evaluate the configuration of the Model Context Protocol tool to ensure appropriate thresholds are being used.
