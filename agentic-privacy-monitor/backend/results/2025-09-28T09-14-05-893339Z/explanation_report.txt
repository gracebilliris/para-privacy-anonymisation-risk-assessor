## Data Privacy Impact Assessment & Reporting

This report summarizes the privacy assessment results for several datasets. The assessment focused on identifying potential privacy risks and evaluating the effectiveness of privacy-enhancing techniques using the Model Context Protocol (MCP). We have identified moderate risks across the datasets, primarily related to the potential for re-identification.

### Dataset: 2021Census_G03_NSW_LGA.csv

**Quasi-Identifiers (QI columns):** `['The dataset includes `LGA_CODE_2021` which', 'in combination with other attributes', 'could potentially enable re-identification.']`
**Sensitive columns:** `['The sensitive attribute is `Total_Total`.']`

**Privacy Risks/Flags:** This dataset contains a quasi-identifier (`LGA_CODE_2021`) and a sensitive attribute (`Total_Total`). The combination could lead to re-identification of individuals within local government areas.

**Recommended Actions:** Implement anonymization techniques to minimize the risk of re-identification. This could include k-anonymity or l-diversity.

**MCP Metric Findings:**

*   **k-anonymity:**
    *   Minimum: 1
    *   Average: 1
    *   Required Threshold: 5

### Dataset: synthetic_privacy_test.csv

**Quasi-Identifiers (QI columns):** `["The dataset contains the quasi-identifier 'ID'."]`
**Sensitive columns:** `["The sensitive attribute in this dataset is 'Disease'."]`

**Privacy Risks/Flags:** This dataset includes a quasi-identifier (`ID`) and a sensitive attribute (`Disease`).  Combining these could enable re-identification.

**Recommended Actions:** Consider implementing k-anonymity or differential privacy to protect the sensitive attribute.

**Overall Assessment & Next Steps:**

The assessment reveals that all datasets present some degree of privacy risk, primarily due to the presence of quasi-identifiers and sensitive attributes. The k-anonymity, l-diversity, and t-closeness metrics across all datasets are not meeting the required thresholds. The re-identification risks, while relatively low in some cases, indicate a potential for individual identification.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Prioritize datasets:** Focus on the datasets with the highest re-identification risk and the lowest metric scores.
2.  **Implement anonymization techniques:** Explore techniques like k-anonymity, l-diversity, differential privacy, or data masking to mitigate privacy risks.
3.  **Review data access controls:**  Limit access to sensitive datasets to only authorized personnel.
4.  **Regular re-assessment:** Conduct regular privacy assessments to ensure the effectiveness of implemented safeguards.
5.  **Consider data minimization:** Evaluate whether all collected data is truly necessary and consider removing or aggregating sensitive information.
